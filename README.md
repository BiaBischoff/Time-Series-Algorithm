# Time-Series-Algorithm
Time Series Project
The objective of this project is to identify patterns in revenue that will offer us a better understanding of the churn data. This understanding will enable us to correlate churn over time, and make data- backed recommendations to company stakeholders to ultimately reduce churn.
